# My First Project
#"Detection and Indication of Pot Holes On Road For Safety Of an Automobile".

# **INTRODUCTION :**

We are going to make a device with the help of ultrasonic sensors & Arduino. 
The ultrasonic sensors are used to detect potholes & that data will be send to control unit through Arduino, so the LED will be blink and alarm will be sound & the driver will know that there is a pothole ahead. 
So this project is will going to be safety features in vehicle in future.

# Following  are used in our pot hole detection system
Ultrasonic sensor
Arduino
Buzzer
LED light

# **Description :**
To built a device which is a universal system that can be installed on any passenger vehicle. 
To detect the presence of potholes and report those potholes to the driver with the help of buzzer.
To display the pothole detection with the help of buzzer and led on the LCD.
